Simple project to parse out a list of items and the times associated with them and make a visual representation of them.
To use this simply copy a list of items into the text box. It supports many formats.

Red 1A.........................................6:05-8:55</br>
ECS A..........................................6:25-8:30</br>
Pent 1F - 4:10pm - 6:45pm</br>
Hawk/Hosp 1D - 1:55pm - 5:10pm</br>

-Bio 10D 15:20-18:30</br>
-Bio 10E 18:20-21:30</br>
